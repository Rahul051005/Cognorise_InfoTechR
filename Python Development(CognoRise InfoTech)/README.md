# Python Projects Repository

This repository contains three exciting Python projects: a Calculator, a Stone-Paper-Scissors game, and a Password Generator. Each project is designed to demonstrate different aspects of Python programming, from basic operations to more complex functionalities.

## Calculator
The Calculator is a simple application developed using Python's Tkinter library. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, making it a great tool for quick calculations.

## Stone-Paper-Scissors Game
The Stone-Paper-Scissors game is a classic game implemented in Python. The game is played against the computer. The player chooses either stone, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes a random choice. The game follows the standard rules of Stone-Paper-Scissors to determine the winner.

## Password Generator
The Password Generator is a useful tool that generates strong, secure passwords. The user can specify the length and the types of characters to include (such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols). The generated passwords are random and hard to guess, enhancing the security of user accounts.

All the projects in this repository are developed with a focus on clean, efficient, and readable code. They serve as excellent examples for anyone learning Python or looking to understand how to implement these functionalities. Feel free to explore the code and learn from it.
